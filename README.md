# Robyn's D&D 5th Edition Dice Roller
This is a tool designed to calculate Dungeons & Dragons 5th edition dice rolls for a Tiefling Celestial Warlock in a *Descent Into Avernus* campaign.  
As this constitutes my first foray into both tabletop gaming and Python programming, the primary goal here is to automate subtly varying calculations that I might otherwise be slow to distinguish in the midst of gameplay, and also enable me to practice programming skills in an applied setting between gaming sessions.

## How to Run
Run the script in any Python environment. A web based graphical user interface is planned.

## Future Improvements
- Connect to an HTML front end for full stack development experience and eased shareability.
- Print important added context to go with a sum total, such as whether the base roll was a critical hit, miss, success, or failure.
